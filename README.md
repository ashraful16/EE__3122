# EE 3122 course is based on Application to Numerical methods & Statistics

Here we learn how to understand how mathematical models of problems arising
in Engineering (and other areas) can be solved numerically.<br>
## The goal of this course is:

<br><b>In Numerical : </b>
<ul>
<li> Solve large systems of simultaneous linear equations.</li>
<li> Find solutions of nonlinear equations using the bisection method, Newton’s methods, and secant method 
  and implement them.</li>
<li>Estimate the solutions of systems of first-order ordinary differential
 equations or higher order ordinary differential equations using various
 numerical methods and implement them.</li>
<li> Apply these techniques to practical problems in Engineering.</li>
<li> Use Prgramming language(Python) for the implementation and application
 of numerical methods and the visualization of results</li>
</ul>
  
<br><b>In Statistics :</b>
<ul>
<li> Applying various graphical and data analysis methods for summarizing and
 understanding data. </li>
<li> Applying various statistical models and methods for drawing conclusions 
and making decisions under uncertainty in engineering contexts</li>
<li> Applying Prgramming language(Python) for graphical and statistical analysis.</li>
</ul>
